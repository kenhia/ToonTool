.SYNOPSIS
    Gets the list of characters (name,realm,region) associated with an account [READ NOTES]

.DESCRIPTION
    Currently this is a non caching function, read the notes.

.NOTES
    This is a placeholder-ish workaround. I haven't solved getting the OAuth for the account in PowerShell yet. For
    now I'm simulating that more or less by (a) going to my test Python-Flask site that /does/ know how to do the
    OAuth, and then (b) populating a web page that I can do a cut-n-paste, and then (c) creating the 'cache' file
    that I would have created once I got the information from Blizzard.

    I'm still building out all the connecting parts, but I /think/ everything we get with /wow/user/characters
    (today) or /profile/{account-id}/wow (soon...now?) we can get with the other profile calls with the exception
    of the list of toons that belong to an account. Based on that, I /think/, we can ignore everything except for
    the Region, Name, and Realm. This does imply an ugly workaround of just creating the JSON file with a list of
    characters that you are interested in.

    Based on the previous, this function just returns an array containing the name and realm of the characters.

    TODO:
    [ ] Make this work correctly :-)
    [ ] Deal with the player's rights; if ANY of the characters are not valid, the cache file should be deleted and
        then re-got from Blizzard (which would presumably not list the user anymore)
