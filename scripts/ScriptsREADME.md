# Scripts folder

This folder contains (will contain) scripts with a couple purposes; hopefully I'll document what they are for in each script; but generally I plan to use this for scripts that:

* Solve a particular need using the ToonTool module to get the needed data
  * For example: what are the weapon level and iLvl for all my 120's?
* Show how to put the pieces together
* Work out how I want to do something in the module

The last I've been doing in the module directly rewriting bits either in part or completely and I will continue to do so, but for ideas that I'm not sure of the approach, it's often cleaner to work outside the module.
